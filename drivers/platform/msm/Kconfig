	  It uses the android timed-output framework.

config QPNP_REVID
	tristate "QPNP Revision ID Peripheral"
	depends on SPMI
	help
	  Say 'y' here to include support for the Qualcomm QPNP REVID

	  in the kernel log along with the PMIC option status. The PMIC
	  type is mapped to a Qualcomm chip part number and logged as well.

config QPNP_COINCELL
	tristate "Qualcomm QPNP coincell charger support"
	depends on SPMI && OF_SPMI
	help
	  This driver supports the QPNP coincell peripheral found inside of
	  Qualcomm QPNP PMIC devices.  The coincell charger provides a means to
	  charge a coincell battery or backup capacitor which is used to
	  maintain PMIC register state when the main battery is removed from the
	  mobile device.

config QPNP_USB_DETECT
	tristate "Qualcomm QPNP USB VBUS Detection"
	depends on POWER_SUPPLY
	help
	  This driver supports external USB VBUS detection circuitry which
	  can be connected to Qualcomm QPNP PMIC devices.  The driver will
	  configure a GPIO from the detector's output line and in turn notify
	  the USB driver of VBUS presence/disconnection using the power_supply
	  framework.

config IPA
	tristate "IPA support"
	depends on SPS && NET
	help
	  This driver supports the Internet Packet Accelerator (IPA) core.
	  IPA is a programmable protocol processor HW block.
	  It is designed to support generic HW processing of UL/DL IP packets
	  for various use cases independent of radio technology.
	  The driver support client connection and configuration
	  for the IPA core.
	  Kernel and user-space processes can call the IPA driver
	  to configure IPA core.

config RMNET_IPA
	tristate "IPA RMNET WWAN Network Device"
	depends on IPA && MSM_QMI_INTERFACE
	help
	  This WWAN Network Driver implements network stack class device.
	  It supports Embedded data transfer from A7 to Q6. Configures IPA HW
	  for RmNet Data Driver and also exchange of QMI messages between
	  A7 and Q6 IPA-driver.

config KLM
	boolean "KLM Driver"
	help
	  This driver handles the power management of the KLM (Key Ladder Module).

config MSM_AVTIMER
	tristate "Avtimer Driver"
	depends on MSM_QDSP6_APRV2
	help
		This driver gets the Q6 out of power collapsed state and
		exposes ioctl control to read avtimer tick.

config PFT
	bool "Per-File-Tagger driver"
	default n
	help
		This driver is used for tagging enterprise files.
		It is part of the Per-File-Encryption (PFE) feature.
		The driver is tagging files when created by
		registered application.
		Tagged files are encrypted using the dm-req-crypt driver.

config SSM
	tristate "Qualcomm Secure Service Module"
	depends on QSEECOM
	depends on MSM_SMD
